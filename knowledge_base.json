Charcloth, resting on a nest \nof well separated fibres of sisal rope, dry grass or \nshredded dry leaves works well.\nPrepare the fire properly in your hearth, with \nsmall pieces of dry twig or stick surrounded by \nincreasingly larger bits of wood. Building a central \ntipi of small sticks will give a ready receptacle for \na blazing tinder ball.",

Allow to cool fully.\n*\tOpen the tin to find the cloth has turned to \ncharcoal due to burning in a limited oxygen \natmosphere.\n*\tKeep the charcloth pieces dry in a zip lock bag.",
